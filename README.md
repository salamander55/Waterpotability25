This project focuses on predicting the potability of water using machine learning techniques. Access to safe drinking water is a critical global issue, and determining whether water is potable requires analyzing multiple chemical and physical parameters such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity. In this project, data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) were performed to handle missing values, understand feature distributions, and identify correlations. Several machine learning models were then trained and evaluated to classify water as potable or not potable. Performance was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure balanced results despite potential class imbalance. The findings highlight which features most strongly influence water quality and demonstrate how predictive modeling can support public health and environmental monitoring.
